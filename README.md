This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I have created To Do List application with React JS. I have designed the site using use flexbox to manage the layout. There is a function of clicking the Add button,adding a new item in the list and increases the list counter.

EDIT: Changed from flexbox to fix to right format for react.js
